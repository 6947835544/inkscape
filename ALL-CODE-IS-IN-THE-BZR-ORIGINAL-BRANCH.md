# Where's the code

All code is in the `bzr-original` branch. This is a mirror of Inkscape's code
in Launchpad.

## Is this official

Inkscape [does have plans to move to git](https://sourceforge.net/p/inkscape/mailman/message/31809342/)
and this repository is owned by Inkscape contributors as an initial attempt
to migrate. It is hoped this will be the final git home for Inkscape, although
that has not been officially decided.

## What is the migration status?

Please see https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape/issues/21
